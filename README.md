# Ray-Tracing-2D


# Preconditions
   - Microsoft Visual Studio IDE
   - Run the project in Debug x86 mode

# Short Description:
   - 2D ray tracing algorithm implementation for a single beam, in a
scene with opaque objects.
   - Objects can be circles or (combinations of) rectangles.
   - Beside the objects mentioned above, there are two special items: light and camera.
   - The purpose is to generate a single beam of light and draw the beam across the scene, using reflections, until the beam of light reaches the camera or a number of reflexions was overcome.

# Key Features:
	1)	R 			-> reset the scene
	2)	+			-> increase drawing speed
	3)	-			-> decrease drawing speed
	4)	SPACE_BAR	-> start drawing

	5)	UP_ARROW	-> increase rays limit to be drawn
	6)	DOWN_ARROW	-> decrease rays limit to be drawn
	7)	LEFT_ARROW	-> increase the angle of the light source ray
	8)	RIGHT_ARROW	-> decrease the angle of the light source ray
